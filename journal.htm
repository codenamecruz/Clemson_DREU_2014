<p>

The first thing we did was get CITI certified (<span><a href="https://www.citiprogram.org/">citiprogram.org </a></span>). This certification ensures that we are familiar with the basic procedures and ethics of conducting research. We were given a list of projects to choose from by Dr. Gilbert. We had a few days to think about them an make a decision. Also, this week we met many of the people who work in the lab from students pursing master's degrees to PhD students, and many Post-docs (Dr's). <br> <br>
Finally, I decided to work on the "Cable Labs" project led by <a style="color: red "href="http://kylamcmullen.com/"><strong>Dr. Kyla McMullen</strong></a> and "Distracted Driving projects" project led by 
<a style="color: red "href="http://www.wandaeugene.com/"><strong>Dr. Wanda Eugene</strong></a>.
